== Live Reload

The Gradle build also can support http://asciidoctor.org/docs/editing-asciidoc-with-live-preview/#livereload[Live Reload]

Start by running the build with Gradle 2.5+ https://docs.gradle.org/2.5/userguide/continuous_build.html[continuous build] feature.

 $ ./gradlew -t asciidoctor

This ensures if you modify any *.adoc file then everything is rebuilt.

Open another terminal and run the liveReload task:

 $ ./gradlew liveReload
